## Overview

Unit-4-Game or more commonly known as - Infinity Stone Collector - is an Avengers themed web game that puts the player in the shoes of Thanos.

### How does it work?
You are Thanos. One of the Eternals. And you will be given a random number at the start of the game.

There are six infinity stones below. By clicking on a stone you will add a specific amount of points to your total score. You will destroy half the world's population if your score matches the number at the beginning at the game. You will get whooped by the lamest Avenger (i.e. Hawkeye) if your score goes above.

The value of each crystal is hidden from you until you click on it. Each time the game starts, the game will change the value of the score, thus, giving you an opportunity to erase another half of the human population. Decrease as much of the world's population before the song ends.
