## Overview

Train Scheduler is a web application that allows a user to enter his or her train time, frequency, destination, and more and then receive accurate up-date train arrival time information.

### How does it work?
The user will enter their train information into the form provided. After submission, the information will popualte the train schedule and automatically update at the specified frequency. The information is stored in Firebase, so even if the user leaves the web page, the information will be saved. If the user no longer takes that train, they can easily delete the entry.
